                DEMOCRACY:
            </h4>
            <p>
                According to the Oxford dictionary, "democracy" is the practice or principles of
                social equiality. The origin is from ancient Greece: demokratia, from demos 'the
                people' + kratia 'power, rule." In essence it is the power of the people. </p>

            <h4>
                VOTESOCRACY:</h4>
            <p>Is a public opinion platform using your individual votes, ratings, rankings and
                surveys to gauge how you really feel. </p>


            <h4>
                TOPICS INCLUDED:</h4>
            <p>
                Consumer retail, entertainment, health sports, science, environment, business,
                technology, news, politics, religion and even sex.</p>

            <h4>
                HOW?:</h4>
            <p>
                There is a possibility that when you see "10,000 likes" on a website, that these
                10,000 likes were not really generated by 10,000 humans. In fact, they could have
                been created by "bots." Internet robots, or programs created to overstate the likes.
                We created a program using simple voice recognition technology that already exists
                to confirm that you are really a human and not an internet robot. </p>

            <h4>
                VOTING

                This includes Polls, Petitions, and even Consumer Complaints. You can vote on any
                subject, you can create a petition and send it to a government official or company
                leader, and even socialize a consumer complaint to see if others are going through
                the same pain you are experiencing. </p>

            <h4>
                RATING
            </h4>
            <p>
                This includes rating a location such as a hotel or restaurant, you can rate photos,
                and or rate anything else you want. </p>

                think of something. We use the standard "Borda" method to calculate the
                ratings. </p>

            <h4>
                SURVEY</h4>

                even about you. </p>

            <h4>
                GETTING PAID FOR YOUR VOTES!</h4>
            <p>
                If an individual or company decides to pay for these features, you will get paid.
                You can even search our database by how much each feature will pay. </p>

            <h4>

                RESULTS
            </h4>
            <p>
                There are 2 types of results. Global results and local results. Certain polls and
                surveys may be limited to geographical locations based on mobile phone location
                services. For example, if the question is "Who do you want to be the next president
                of the United States?" then the local results will reflect user votes based in the
                USA. However, if you choose Global results, you will see what the rest of the world
                thinks of this question as well. </p>

            <h4>
                LEVELS</h4>
            <p>
                Users can be individuals or an individual representing a company or
                organization. </p>

            <h4>
                Level 1:</h4>
            <p> As a LEVEL 1 user, all you have to enter is your email ID. This will allow you to
                search and browse all the results but your results will only be counted in the
                Global results. You can never participate in local based polls or surveys and can
                never get paid. </p>
            <h4>
                Level 2: </h4>
            <p> As a LEVEL 2 user and in addition to Level 1 requirements, you must enter your first
                and last name, you date of birth, gender and get voice recognition validation. This
                will allow you to VOTE. </p>

            <h4>
                Level 3:</h4>
            <p> As a LEVEL 3 user, you will enter personal information about yourself in order to
                get PAID for polls and surveys. There is a special feature where the more
                information you provide, the more you will get paid for each survey. We think you
                will agree, that why should companies take this information from you, when you have
                the choice to sell it? </p>

            <h4>
                YOUR ACCOUNT</h4>
            <p>
                If you want to get paid, you need to provide your account details. If you do not
                want to enter your bank details, you have the choice to contribute the money you
                earned to a charity listed in the accounts section. All monies left in account from
                one year of joining that have not been transferred to your account or to a charity
                will be forfeited. You can only transfer money to your account after each $50 USD
                earned.

                If you want to pay people to take polls and surveys, then you will need to enter a
                credit card number. </p>
